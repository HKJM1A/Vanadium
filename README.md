# Lithium-nuker-v3
I created this tool to achieve something for myself in the new year **2026**.

It's a combination of the x444 tool in terms of some of the commands I modified, and a Lithium tool in terms of appearance. I modified the tool extensively so that you wouldn't say it's a "skidz" tool; it only adopted the appearance!
# Lithium nuker it's a malware!
No, it's safe and you can use it anytime; it doesn't contain any malware that could harm your device.
